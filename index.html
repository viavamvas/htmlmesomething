    <p>We left STL on a Wednesday afternoon because my boss wouldn't let me go earlier. 
        We grabbed an uber on our way to Dallas, Texas. Already on the plane, 
        the flight attendant announced our flight was going to be delayed because of a malfunction.
        We left an hour late and landed with 12 minutes to go from one gate to the other. 
        We arrived to the gate where our plane was about to part from Dallas to Cancun one minute after the door was closed. 
        What do you think happened?</p>
    <p>If you thought they let us in, you're wrong. The plane left us, and we exchanged our hopes for hotel vouchers. 
        Oh and they kept our bags. Yay airlines!</p>

            After flying out of Dallas the next morning (at 4 a.m), we landed in Charlotte, NC. We waited for a couple of hours and then flew to Cancun.
            We landed on Mexico at 2 p.m. to discover our bags had been flown to Miami. So, defeated and stinky, we went to our hotel which welcomed us 
            with a beautiful view of the ocean.

                The next day was just magical. The ocean was beautiful, we hung out all day in the pool, and later, we had a wedding. 
                Although I was very sunburnt, my dress covered up the burns quite well. He had a really nice day!

                <p> The last day we went on a boat trip to Isla Mujeres with a group of friends. The sunset was incredible. Our trip was really nice, short, but nice.</p>
